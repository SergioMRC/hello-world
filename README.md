# about me
This section is something about me.

# >_ Hola, I'm Sergio 

I'm a determined and passionate developer-in-training, making a significant career change to build a new future in web development. My journey has been one of resilience—from running my own business in Kyiv to rebuilding my life in Madrid. Now, I'm channeling that same energy into mastering the MERN stack and crafting beautiful, functional web applications.

**I'm driven by a passion for building powerful and elegant digital experiences.**

### -> My Current Mission

I am on a focused mission to become a full-stack web developer. My learning is intensive and hands-on, with a clear roadmap.

-    **Actively Learning:** Immersing myself in the fundamentals with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
-    **Future Focus:** Diving deep into the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to become a complete developer.
-    **Ultimate Goal:** To work as a remote/freelance developer, or build my own projects as an indie developer.
